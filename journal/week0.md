# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture

## **Getting Started**

I began by completing all of the prerequisite tasks that I did not already know/have.

- Created a new AWS account with free tier benefits.
  - A neat trick I learned is that you can use same email to create different AWS account by using aliases.
  - For example if your email is example@example.com, then you can use example+something@example.com
- Did the free CCP course from Exampro to get familiar with AWS.
- Created Gitpod account.
- Created Momento Account.
- Obtained a Custom Domain Name from Porkbun.
- Signed up for Lucid Charts.
- Signed up for HoneyComb.io.
- Signed up for Rollbar.

## Project Scenario

The first thing I learned from the live session was how to understand the project and how an organization approaches it.
The way this is communicated through user personas has really helped me understand how things are done in an organization.

**Cruddur** is an ephemeral first micro blogging platform ( a lot like twitter but the posts are ephemeral like snapchat posts)

- Backend uses Flask micro web framework (Python)
- Frontend uses React
- The project includes
  - SQL and NoSQL Databases
  - Realtime Modern APIs
  - Multiple Container Services ( *Microservices)
  - A CI/CD Pipeline
  - Decentralized Authentication
  - And more

## Architecting Cloud

Before building out the project, clearly understand what the business wants, so discuss with technical and business team and make sure it satisfies all the facets of the project.

It should address the risks, assumptions and constraints.

There are 3 stages to designing an architectural diagram.

1. Conceptual Design
2. Logical Design
3. Physical Design

### Conceptual Design

This is a high level design where only the basic working of the project is depicted. Mostly used to convey the idea to business stakeholders or other non technical members. This type of designing is also called a **Napkin Design** because it can be drawn on a napkin when you get that spur-of-the-moment idea.

### Logical Design

In this stage of the design use the services provided by CSP to create a blueprint diagram of how each services are connected and used. Don't go into in depth details of each service just an icon and name indicating what it is. This type of design is also called a **Blueprint**.

### Physical Design

Represents the actual thing thats built including the specification of each services, IP address, ARN, API gateway, etc.
